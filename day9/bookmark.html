        <p>Allu Arjun is an Indian actor who primarily appears in Telugu films. In 1985, at the age of three, he made his debut in the film Vijetha, directed by A. Kodandarami Reddy. Sixteen years later, Arjun made a small appearance as Gopi, a dancer, in the 2001 film Daddy directed by Suresh Krissna.[1] He had his first leading role in the 2003 film Gangotri, directed by K. Raghavendra Rao which was the latter's hundredth film as a director.[2] In the film, Arjun played an adolescent named Simhadri living in Rayalaseema, who falls in love with a factionist's daughter.

            Arjun played the role of a college student in two films — Sukumar's directorial debut Arya, and V. V. Vinayak's Bunny. His role in the former was his breakthrough, earning him his first Nandi Special Jury Award. Arjun collaborated with A. Karunakaran on the film Happy, in which he played a villager completing his graduation in Hyderabad while working part-time as a pizza delivery boy.[3] The film was a commercial success with its dubbed version becoming an all time blockbuster in Kerala.</p>
